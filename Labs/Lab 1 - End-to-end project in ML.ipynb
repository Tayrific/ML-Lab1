In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model a dataset with the purpose of prediction. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook.\n",

If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) that are based on the standard console.

We are using the programming language as a *scripting* language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a *console*. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The *state* of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.  "

        "`OneHotEncoder()` and `StandardScaler()` are examples of [data transformations](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html). In scikit-learn these are referred to as *transformers* and they map the data from one format to another. In a programming context, transformers are classes. They come with the following methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `fit` that is used to learn the  transformation from data.\n",
        "- `transform` that is used to transform the data once the transformer has been fitted.   \n",
        "- `fit_transform` that applies first `fit` and then `transform` to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically, we use either `fit` or `fit_transform` for the training data and `transform` for the validation or test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the one-hot-encoding and standardisation transformations will be applied to different columns in the dataset, it is convenient to have a function that applies them both. It is particularly useful since we need to apply those transformations to the train, validation and test sets. We could code such function from scratch, but here, we make use of the [ColumnTransformer()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html?highlight=columntransformer#sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer), an estimator available in scikit-learn that allows to group different transformations into a single method. `ColumnTransformer` is an example of an *estimator* in scikit-learn. An estimator is an object that provides predictions for new data. Besides the `fit`, `transform` and `fit_transform` methods, they most of the times provide the additional `predict` method for making predictions on the test data.\n",

        "A [pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html#pipeline) is a very convenient estimator in scikit-learn. Explain what is a pipeline and describe in which situations it is useful."
